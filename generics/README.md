# Generics in Python

This section demonstrates the use of generics in Python using type hints and the `typing` module. We'll explore various aspects of generic programming through practical examples.

## Topics Covered

1. Basic Generic Types
   - Generic functions
   - Generic classes
   - Type variables
   - Bounded type variables

2. Common Generic Collections
   - List[T]
   - Dict[K, V]
   - Set[T]
   - Optional[T]
   - Union types

3. Advanced Generic Patterns
   - Covariance and Contravariance
   - Generic protocols
   - Type aliases
   - Self types
   - TypeVar with constraints

## Examples

We'll implement several practical examples:

1. A generic `Stack[T]` data structure
2. A generic `Result[T, E]` type for error handling
3. A generic `Repository[T]` interface for data access
4. A generic `Cache[K, V]` implementation
5. A generic `EventHandler[T]` for type-safe event handling

Each example will demonstrate different aspects of generic programming and include comprehensive tests to verify type safety and functionality.

## Type Checking

All examples will be compatible with:
- mypy
- pyright
- pylance

We'll demonstrate how to:
- Set up type checking in your project
- Handle common type checking errors
- Use type assertions effectively
- Document generic code properly

## Best Practices

- When to use generics
- How to name type variables
- Generic design patterns
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Performance considerations

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- mypy
- pytest
