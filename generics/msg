This PR adds a generic Repository pattern implementation to demonstrate bounded type parameters and protocols in Python.

Key Features:
- Generic Repository[T, ID] interface with bounded type parameters
- InMemoryRepository implementation for testing and examples
- Comprehensive tests for different ID types (string, UUID, int)
- Example usage with User and Post entities
- Integration with existing Result[T, E] type for error handling

Technical Highlights:
- Type-safe operations with compile-time checking
- Protocol-based design with Identifiable[ID]
- Proper error handling using Result type
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clear examples in main.py

All tests are passing and the code is well-documented with examples.
